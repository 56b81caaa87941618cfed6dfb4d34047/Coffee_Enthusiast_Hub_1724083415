    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_1": "What's the difference between Arabica and Robusta coffee?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_1": "Arabica beans are known for their smooth, complex flavor with hints of sugar, fruit, and berries. Robusta beans have a stronger, harsher taste with a grainy overtone and peanutty aftertaste. Arabica is generally considered higher quality, while Robusta has more caffeine.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_2": "How should I store coffee to keep it fresh?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_2": "Store coffee in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. Avoid refrigerating or freezing as this can introduce moisture and affect flavor. For best results, buy whole beans and grind only what you need for each brew.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_3": "What's the best brewing method for a rich flavor?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_3": "While personal preference plays a role, many coffee enthusiasts prefer the French press or pour-over methods for a rich, full-bodied flavor. These methods allow for better control over brewing time and water temperature, resulting in a more flavorful cup.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_4": "How does the roast level affect coffee taste?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_4": "Roast levels greatly impact flavor. Light roasts retain more of the bean's original flavor and have higher acidity. Medium roasts offer a balanced flavor, aroma, and acidity. Dark roasts have a bolder, more intense flavor with less acidity and often a slight bitterness.",
